      Are you frequentist or bayesian?
    </h3>
    <p>You have a coin that when flipped ends up head with probability p and ends up tail with probability 1âˆ’p. (The value of p is unknown.)Trying to estimate p, you flip the coin 14 times. It ends up head 10 times. Then you have to decide on the following event: "In the next two tosses we will get two heads in a row." Would you bet that the event will happen or that it will not happen?</p>
